It's 2006.

You get home from school and log on MSN Messenger to chat with your online friends.

Your best friend ~~hits you with a big and smelly tuna~~ pings you to tell you they updated their blog.

It's a mortifying insult to web-design: it's built on tables and elements are aligned by the
abuse of multiple *&amp;nbsp&#59;s*. The right column is cluttered with small gifs with tiny pixel writings
such as "yaoi teh best" and "soriku 4eva". You took inspiration from their layout for your own blog...
you linked them the gifs, though.

Your friend wrote about going out on Sunday and the comics they bought.
It's trivial, but since it's from someone you love, you enjoy it.

You leave a comment and rush to your own blog to document your last weekend.

It's 2020. We write a lot more online, but it feels like anything hardly sticks.
Communication is super fast and most social networks feel like glorified chatrooms where
the mods are assholes.

I like chatrooms! I like fast communication! But I've felt something was missing.

**That's 200X era blogging, man!**

I've been into journaling for the past 3-4 years and I've felt it was extremely relaxing.
But it's bullet journaling: far from long form writing.

So I thought... let's get back into blogging. It's not extinct and it's not unfeasible, it just
isn't as common anymore. I'd love to share the journey into
*rediscovering the joys of ol' time blogging* with ~~the girl reading this~~ whoever's reading this!

Let's have fun.

Now, onto the *Commitment* part.

When I study things on my own I tend to either absorb the knowledge or jot it down somewhere
and forget it forever. *Forever!* The other day I discovered **again** Ctrl+R is the FL Studio
shortcut for humanizing midi patterns and forgot it **again** the day after.

But now that I wrote it **here** I'll remember it **forever**.
Or so I hope.

Anyway, I'll be mostly recording what I learn in here.

Hey ya.

Remember Ciao Nonna? [I've won for the best story/setting](https://itch.io/jam/i-cant-draw-but-want-to-make-a-game-again/results/best-storysetting). I know.

***HOW***

I consider myself an okay writer: I write pretty good dialogue at times, I suck a lot at descriptions. It be like that.

I think I got better during last years, though. Mostly at dialogue. I hate descriptions. Can I just write scripts?

Anyway, Ciao Nonna doesn't have descriptions and I find myself very comfortable in sticking words inside tiny textboxes. I want to build more worlds through character interactions alone.

Also, Asimov didn't dwell too much on environments either!!

**P. S.** I've said I've won a prize but the only prize is the glory: *my favorite prize of all.*

The right column is cluttered with small gifs with tiny pixel writings such as &quot;yaoi teh best&quot; and &quot;soriku 4eva&quot;. You took inspiration from their layout for your own blog... you linked them the gifs, though.</p><p>Your friend wrote about going out on Sunday and the comics they bought. It's trivial, but since it's from someone you love, you enjoy it.</p><p>You leave a comment and rush to your own blog to document your last weekend.</p><p>It's 2020. We write a lot more online, but it feels like anything hardly sticks. Communication is super fast and most social networks feel like glorified chatrooms where the mods are assholes.</p><p>I like chatrooms! I like fast communication! But I've felt something was missing.</p><p><strong>That's 200X era blogging, man!</strong></p><p>I've been into journaling for the past 3-4 years and I've felt it was extremely relaxing. But it's bullet journaling: far from long form writing.</p><p>So I thought... let's get back into blogging. It's not extinct and it's not unfeasible, it just isn't as common anymore. I'd love to share the journey into <em>rediscovering the joys of ol' time blogging</em> with <s>the girl reading this</s> whoever's reading this!</p><p>Let's have fun.</p><p>Now, onto the <em>Commitment</em> part.</p><p>When I study things on my own I tend to either absorb the knowledge or jot it down somewhere and forget it forever. <em>Forever!</em> The other day I discovered <strong>again</strong> Ctrl+R is the FL Studio shortcut for humanizing midi patterns and forgot it <strong>again</strong> the day after.</p><p>But now that I wrote it <strong>here</strong> I'll remember it <strong>forever</strong>. Or so I hope.</p><p>Anyway, I'll be mostly recording what I learn in here.</p><span class="signed">&#60;/cre&#62;</span></div><div id="comments"></div></div></div></div><script>const navButton = document.querySelector("#nav-button");

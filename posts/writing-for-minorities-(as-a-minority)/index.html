I <em>consumed</em> book after book and prided myself in reading books targeted to older children. I was <em>so</em> smart.</p><p>I still dropped <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> at age 11.</p><p>Despite this (the hate for writing, not the dislike for Tolkien), I was pretty good at doing so for school. I wrote the blandest essays on the same 3-4 themes in rotation in high school (my class wasn't very exciting) and I remember twisting them in middle school just to make them a bit more exciting.</p><p>Fact is, I'm <em>very</em> into fantasizing and <em>way less</em> into actually putting words on a blank page. I'm sure this is a very common feeling, actually.</p><p>Actually! Actually! I'm <strong>very not</strong> into filtering whatever comes out of my brain, molding it into a cohesive story, feeling, or landscape. I often find myself writing sparsely, putting words here and there and then connecting the dots, hoping it will all make sense in the end. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Often, I don't care much.</p><p>Being this a blog I write for myself mostly, the latter is true. Which is why this thing is titled &quot;Writing for minorities&quot; and I still haven't mentioned a single minority except for maybe &quot;kids who dropped <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> at age 11&quot;. The most oppressed category.</p><p>The idea of &quot;writing for minorities&quot; is something that wormed its way into my brain very recently. I'll be using my pet project, <em>Toumayhem</em> (to which I work at my own pace but man do I cherish it even with its flaws), to illustrate this further.</p><p><em>Toumayhem</em> was born in a time where I had the urge to write about anxiety. The main character mirrors a good part of my own experience with a mild anxiety disorder and the general feeling in plotting it was &quot;I want to make others feel less lonely&quot;. That feeling is still the main theme of not only that, but also pretty much everything I write and produce.</p><p>The main character Yuki is, however, a guy. That wouldn't be a problem if this hadn't been influenced by the thought that I didn't want to have anyone think I was writing about <em>myself</em>. Having a guy, and not a girl, as the main character put the needed distance between me and the story, as did not setting it in my country and a bunch of other small things I accurately put thought into not because of the story but because I couldn't bear to bare myself in a way I was not in control of.</p><p>Granted, I feel like years later Yuki reflects a very old image of me and as I was writing him I gave him quirks and feelings I can relate too but which are his own. Still, that silly &quot;oh no what if someone thinks this is my self-insert&quot; did influence me quite a bit.</p><p>Which leads me to what I've been trying to say up to this point, but editing is a bitch and, as I made clear already, I like the sound of my own talking (or my own typing, in this case): <em>can I write about minorities if the minority is me?</em></p><p>Do I have the right to take up space?</p><p>Oh boy!</p><p>I know some who read this blog personally. I know some will feel that sentence resonate with them, and I know they often answered that question with &quot;No, I should make myself smaller&quot;.</p><p>After years of repeating so like a mantra, one day, I finally snapped.</p><p>I <strong>don't</strong> want to make myself smaller!</p><p>And when you finally stretch your limbs out and you feel how <em>different</em> it is and how many of your peers share that feeling you felt so lonely in,</p><p>well,</p><p>you tend to get kind of pissed!</p><p>So I subtly went from &quot;I don't want to write about lesbians, it's too embarrassing&quot; to &quot;maybe... maybe I can write a lesbian in this&quot; to &quot;Oh I might give her a girlfriend... but no more gays in this&quot; to &quot;oh fuck everyone's LGBT+ until I say otherwise wait these two guys are het just for the quota&quot;.</p><p>It's all linked to the real reason why I write: sometimes you just have stuff boiling inside of you and you either put it out there in whatever form you need or you <strong>DIE</strong>.</p><p>I'm dramatic like that.</p><span class="signed">&#60;/cre&#62;</span></div><div id="comments"></div></div></div></div><script>const navButton = document.querySelector("#nav-button");

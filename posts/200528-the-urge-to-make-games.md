pageTitle: The urge to make games

I've got a bit of a hobby problem.

While I've devoted my body and soul to music since age 5, I've always been interested in a lot of things. When I was 13 I wanted to learn how to play **EVERY INSTRUMENT** (I was a hopeless megalomaniac). I picked up so many skills during my childhood and teenage years because "if this person can do it, so can I!". Constantly pissed off by not being able to do *everything on my own*. Thankfully, I can handle playing on a team now.

I'm a *jack of all trades, master of none* (*certainly better* — I mutter to myself — *than master of one*).

I'm just very passionate about a lot of things, which means long-term focus is a bit of an issue. Other people's drive and hard work inspire me to do better, and I'm a slave to my own enthusiasm.

I've been looking at a lot of indie games lately and reading the progress of multiple game devs, which is something I should be qualified to call myself having made more than a game, but... it always feels too much. It's not modesty, I just feel like I should be coding *more*. Them again, games are games regardless of the effort put into coding. Right?

Anyway I've felt such a strong urge to deliver more games lately and it's all the indies' fault. Bless you all.

Here's a comprehensive list of the projects that battle in my brain all day long to be worked on.

## That game about lesbian emperors
I've written [Emperor's Lesbian New Groove](https://crescendo.itch.io/emperors-lesbian-new-groove) (rebranding soon!) with a friend on 2016; we were both in university at the time and I had to take a break from a terrible, terrible year in which I kept failing at my one last exam. Now in 2020 we've both graduated but we're still so hooked. This project we made up together for fun got so much under our skin we could not stop thinking about it even when we had no time nor drive to keep at it.

I'm really glad I could work with Cri because, even though it's going to be short (three routes spanning 4 days + ending scene each), it's always going to be special to us. Also writing with someone you trust **ROCKS**.

## A badly drawn game in Godot
I stumbled upon [I Can't Draw But Want To Make A Game (Again)](https://itch.io/jam/i-cant-draw-but-want-to-make-a-game-again) a few weeks ago and have dreamed about finally giving Godot (after having a bad fight with Unity trying to develop a 2D game with it) a good chance. For a jam. During which I have several other things to do. *Jack of all trades*.

I have a concept for it, but I'm not very confident in how fun it could be. I'll probably try to make it charming more than fun, but sometimes I'd just like to work on genuinely fun games...

## Toumayhem
This is my **pet project**. It's been the first visual novel I wanted to work on and I first drafted it in 2012. There have been times when I've worked on it for days, weeks, and then dropped it again until next time, rebuilding it again. Despite everything, it's always been my pet project and there's so much of me in it if I don't ever deliver it I'll **die**. Seriously, I will die. I've considered writing a will in which I ask anyone to write it starting from vague plot points. That's how devoted I am, *despite never working on it*.

Long story short, an anxious high school kid gets roped into standing against systematic bullying by his self-proclaimed new best friend and others who refused to be part of the system. At some point, people die. Adults are useless. There's a tint of sci-fi in this.

It's gotten through several revisions but I feel like most of it still feels naive. I'm sure it won't ever be a masterpiece but I just really need to share it without worrying too much about making a great thing; I just want it to be at least enjoyable.

I'm actually on a schedule to finish some serious plotting this month but I've been stuck on what I really want it to be played like. Should I move away from a visual novel format? Should I think of flashier stuff to put in?

For now, I'm focusing on writing.

## Why haven't I made a rhythm game yet
Because it's hard as hell. I do have a concept but since it's heavily Rhythm Heaven-inspired it also requires a GREAT number of assets I'm not able to make by myself because I'm only half-decent at drawing. But it's been stuck in the back of my mind.

## RPG with a card-based battle system
I need to cope with the lack of Mega Man Battle Network/Star Force on Switch. Also, card-based battle systems are DOPE.

## SMT-inspired short game set in Italy
I love the cheesiest "It was Tokyo ALL ALONG" plot twists, so common years ago they stopped being unexpected. I love them. But sometimes I wish it had been another city all along.

If no one gives me a post-apocalyptic experience set in a half-destroyed Italian city I'LL DO IT. It's a rough concept and I've got nothing in mind plot-wise, but it's such a fascinating idea to me...

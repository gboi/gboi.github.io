*What's gboi?*

First letter of first name chained to my last name. It's my [Github](https://github.com) handle, but I usually go by **Cre**(scendo) online.

I'm an engineer working in web development by day, musician and composer by night. I cover videogame and anime music [on YouTube](http://youtube.com/crescendotto) bi-weekly.

I also occasionally dabble in [game dev](https://crescendo.itch.io/) and like to pixel art sometimes. I made the icon on the left! If you're not on mobile, that is.

I like videogames and learning. Hopefully I can share some of the latter here.
